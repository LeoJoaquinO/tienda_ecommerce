- Background color: Very light pink (#F9E2DE).
- Accent color: Sunset orange (#D9A770) for a sophisticated, attention-grabbing highlight that remains consistent with the site's aesthetic.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text. Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text, enhancing readability while maintaining elegance.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different product categories and UI actions (e.g., shopping cart, user profile).
- Implement a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations to highlight product interactions (e.g., adding to cart, image transitions) to enhance user engagement without being intrusive.
