### 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

To get a local copy up and running on your computer, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/joya-store.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd joya-store
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up Environment Variables (Optional for Local Dev):**
    *   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
    *   The application will run with **hardcoded sample data** by default. You do not need to fill in any keys to run the app locally.
    *   If you *want* to connect to a development database, add your PostgreSQL connection string (`DATABASE_URL`) to `.env.local`.
    *   For payment testing, you can add your **Mercado Pago Test Credentials**. You can find your PublicKey and Access Token in your [Mercado Pago Developer Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/panel/credentials).
    *   For the newsletter form to work, you will need to add your **Mailchimp Credentials**.
    ```env
    # --- DATABASE (OPTIONAL FOR LOCAL DEV) ---
    # If this is not set, the app will use hardcoded sample data.
    # DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
    
    # --- MERCADO PAGO (USE TEST CREDENTIALS) ---
    MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MERCADOPAGO_PUBLIC_KEY="YOUR_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:9002"

    # --- MAILCHIMP (OPTIONAL) ---
    # To enable the newsletter subscription form.
    # MAILCHIMP_API_KEY="your_mailchimp_api_key"
    # MAILCHIMP_SERVER_PREFIX="your_mailchimp_server_prefix" # e.g., us21
    # MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID="your_mailchimp_audience_id"
    ```
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
6.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

With the default setup (no database credentials), the admin panel will show a "Local Fallback" data source badge, and any changes you make will not be saved.

## 🚀 Recommended: Deploying to Vercel (Easiest Method)

This guide will walk you through deploying your application to Vercel, which is the platform built by the creators of Next.js. It's the most seamless way to go live.

### Part 1: Get Your Project on GitHub

First, you need to store your code in a GitHub repository. Vercel will connect directly to it.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    *   Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
    *   Click the **+** icon in the top-right and select **"New repository"**.
    *   Choose a name (e.g., `joya-store`) and select **"Private"**.
    *   **Do not** initialize it with a README or other files.
    *   Click **"Create repository"**. Copy the repository URL it shows you.

2.  **Upload Your Code:**
    *   Open a terminal in your project's folder and run these commands:
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    # Replace the URL with your new repository's URL
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/joya-store.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    *   Refresh your GitHub page. Your code is now online!

### Part 2: Deploy to Vercel & Create Your Database

Now, we'll connect Vercel to your GitHub repository, create a database, and tell your project the secret keys.

1.  **Import Your Project:**
    *   Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with your GitHub account.
    *   On your Vercel dashboard, go to the **"Projects"** tab and click **"Add New... > Project"**.
    *   Find your `joya-store` repository and click **"Import"**.

2.  **Create and Connect a Database:**
    *   Before deploying, go to the **"Storage"** tab in your Vercel project configuration.
    *   Click **"Create Database"** and choose **"Postgres"**.
    *   Give it a name (e.g., `joya-db`), choose a region, and accept the terms.
    *   After the database is created, Vercel will automatically connect it to your project. This sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for you.

3.  **Configure Other Environment Variables:**
    *   This is the most important step. In the "Environment Variables" section, you will add your secret keys.
    *   **Mercado Pago Variables:** Get these from your [Mercado Pago Developer Dashboard](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers). Use your **Production** credentials.
        *   `MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Production "Access Token".
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_MERCADOPAGO_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Production "Public Key".
    *   **Mailchimp Variables (Optional):** To enable the newsletter form, you need to add these. You can find them in your Mailchimp account under Account > Extras > API Keys.
        *   `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY`: Your Mailchimp API Key.
        *   `MAILCHIMP_SERVER_PREFIX`: The server prefix from your API key (e.g., "us21").
        *   `MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID`: Your Audience ID.
    *   **Site URL Variable:** Vercel will assign you a domain (e.g., `joya-store-abcdef.vercel.app`). You need to add it here so Mercado Pago knows where to send users back to.
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: The full URL of your site.
    *   Click **"Deploy"**. Vercel will build and launch your application. It might take a few minutes.

### Part 3: Create the Database Tables (CRITICAL)

Your Vercel Postgres database is currently empty. We need to create the `products`, `orders`, and `coupons` tables.

1.  On your Vercel dashboard, go to the **Storage** tab, select your database, and then click on the **"Query"** tab.
2.  Open the `database.sql` file in your project, **copy the entire content**, and paste it into the query editor on Vercel.
3.  Click **"Run"**. This will create the necessary table structure.

### Part 4: Configure Mercado Pago Webhook

After your site is live with HTTPS, you must tell Mercado Pago where to send payment updates.

1.  **Go to your Mercado Pago Developer Dashboard.**
2.  Navigate to **Your Applications > (Your App Name) > Webhooks**.
3.  In the "Production" URL field, enter the full URL to your new webhook endpoint. It will be your Vercel production domain followed by `/api/mercadopago-webhook`. For example:
    ```
    https://joya-store-abcdef.vercel.app/api/mercadopago-webhook
    ```
4.  Under "Events", make sure that **Payments** (`payment`) is selected.
5.  Save your changes. This step is essential for your server to receive payment confirmations.

### You're Live!

Congratulations! Your store is now fully deployed and running on a live database at the URL Vercel provided.

-   **Go to the `/admin` page** on your live site to add your real products. Check for the green "Data Source: Database" badge to confirm you're connected.
-   **Future Updates:** Every time you `git push` new changes to your `main` branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy the site for you.
